# Wind_Turbine_Model
The overall objective here is to explore the feasibility 
of meeting the energy needs of our campus (Earlham College) using 
wind turbines. For simplicity, we will model the operation 
of one turbine.  <P><BR>
    
As a first step, we must estimate the average or typical energy 
usage of our campus.  Shown below is the annual electricity 
usage for the years 2008-2013.
